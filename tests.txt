Tests that the Robot has been programmed to run (loosely correspond to milestones)
-1) Display US, IR amp, LS and Identify dummy. All outputs to Serial monitor
0) Current action plan. Competition code. Currently: drive forward grab/push dummy into box (hopefully) do a 180 and drive back to the box
1) Spin the wheels
2+3) Move forwards ~1m and flash the orange LED. Can be used for moving over ramp test too
4) Turn clockwise, anticlockwise, reverse ~1m
5) Turn towards nearest dummy and drive straight into it
9) Grab dummy, drive forwards, drop dummy and reverse
12) Follow line test. Just runs follow_line(false), meaning follow line forwards (reversed = false)
13) US Test. Drive until too close to an obstacle, then turn until path is more clear
14) Locate dummy, home on dummy, pick up dummy
15) Identify dummy
17) Test (and calibrate) turn(180)
21) Run the main code section, robot state = 0
22) Turning calibration program. 2 full turns
23) Accurate turning demo
