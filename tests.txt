Tests that the Robot has been programmed to run (loosely correspond to milestones)
-1) Display US, IR amp, LS. All outputs to Serial monitor
0) Current action plan. Competition code. Currently: drive forward grab/push dummy into box (hopefully) do a 180 and drive back to the box
1) Spin the wheels
2+3) Move forwards ~1m and flash the orange LED. Can be used for moving over ramp test too
4) Turn 360 clockwise, anticlockwise, reverse ~1m
5) Turn towards nearest dummy and drive straight into it
12) Follow line test. Just runs follow_line(false), meaning follow line forwards (reversed = false)
20) Demo of reversible follow_line(). Uses either IR or US to detect dummy and change direction to 'run away'
